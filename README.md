# GoLang Challenges
My first program made with GoLang.

I used PostGreSQL and Go to complete a couple of challenges.

function.sql contains an SQL function designed to concatonate domain names with subdirectories and return only the domain of any 'spots' with duplicate domains.

endpoint.go is designed to take in a longitude, latitude, distance and shape, defined in the main function and return any 'spots' found in the database that fall within the search radius.
